# Overview

This program helps manage a Student gradebook by allowing the user to input students, add assignments and grades for those assignments, and view the Students and their grades.

I wrote this program to learn about programming in the Java language.

# Future Work
Thing I would include:
- Ability to add first and last names of students
- Flexibility to change the names of the students
- adding a system where I could weigh the grades based on which assignments they are.
